AndroidXmlToCsv
===============

AndroidXmlToCsv is a simple java app that converts android string xml files to a single csv and back the other way round. The goal of this app is to provide a simple way to share a csv to collaborate translation of android strings.

###Usage xml to csv
Simply create a folder with subfolders for every language you want to translate from, e.g. "de" and "en".

Start the process with the following parameters:

```
--path [path to folder] --origLang [original language] --targetLangs [target languages] --filename [name of the csv file]
```

The app creates a subfolder '''csv/''' where the result is stored.
